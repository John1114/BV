FOR Thursday 10/27

- load firestore from firebaseConfig

startup_signup
- should we add userId as part of the startup signup form input?
	* are we sure that those who access this form are invited?
	* should we make sure they are logged in or have a user id for the website before the form?
- route after form submission
	* should I use nextjs router or just a new reload of page to index?
- display results to user after successful submission?
- what happens if submission doesn't go through?

startupSignupApi
- add interface for form data type input to check for required fields
